Comment for humans is the next step in the no-follow family. The intention is to remove any search engine benefit from leaving a comment.

== Description ==

Comment for humans is the next step in the no-follow family. I intended this to remove any possible benefit that commenters might get from search engines without inconveniencing the readers of the blog.

Comment for humans intercepts the output from the <?php comment_author_link() ?> template tag to prevent it outputting a link.

The PHP outputs the author name and URL which the javascript picks up and turns into a link.

== Installation ==

Add to the plugin directory then turn it on.
